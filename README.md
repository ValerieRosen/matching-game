## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## How To Play

Click on two squares to find a match. If cards match they turn green. If cards do not match they go back to black. Once all eight matches are found the game is over. At the end a modal pops up to display total time it took to find all the matches, total number of moves and total number of stars that is dependent upon how many moves were taken. Two buttons on the modal allow the start of a new game or you can cancel to go back to the screen showing all the matches. There is also a replay button to start the game over during the game play.
